# Precision RAG: Prompt Tuning For Building Enterprise Grade RAG Systems

## Overview

Welcome to the Precision RAG project! This project focuses on developing advanced prompt tuning techniques tailored for building enterprise-grade Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. RAG systems combine the power of large-scale language models with information retrieval to generate contextually relevant responses to user queries.

## Features

- **Prompt Tuning Algorithms**: Implementation of state-of-the-art prompt tuning algorithms and techniques optimized for building enterprise-grade RAG systems.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Calculation of evaluation metrics to assess the effectiveness of prompts and the performance of RAG systems.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of machine learning models for retrieval and generation tasks in RAG systems.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed documentation on project architecture, usage guides, and tutorials to help users understand and utilize the project effectively.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured organization for easy navigation and understanding:

- `data/`: Directory to store data used for prompt tuning and evaluation.
- `src/`: Source code directory containing prompt tuning algorithms, evaluation scripts, machine learning models, and utility functions.
- `tests/`: Directory containing unit tests and integration tests for the project.
- `docs/`: Documentation directory with architecture diagrams, usage guides, and tutorials.
- `examples/`: Directory containing example scripts and notebooks demonstrating the usage of the project.

## Usage

For detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory. Here are some basic usage steps:

1. **Prepare Data**: Organize prompt datasets and evaluation data in the `data/` directory.
2. **Implement Prompt Tuning**: Use the prompt tuning algorithms in the `src/prompt_tuning/` directory to fine-tune prompts for your RAG system.
3. **Evaluate System Performance**: Utilize the evaluation scripts in the `src/evaluation/` directory to assess the effectiveness of prompts and the performance of your RAG system.
4. **Explore Examples**: Refer to the example scripts and notebooks in the `examples/` directory for demonstrations and use case scenarios.
